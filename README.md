Retrieve the RBAC permissions of serviceAccounts, pods and nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, and evaluate them using policies written in Rego.

The [default policy library](./lib) includes ~20 policies that identify serviceAccounts, pods and nodes that possess risky permissions, each detecting a different attack path. See the Recommendations section [here](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/whitepapers/kubernetes-privilege-escalation-excessive-permissions-in-popular-platforms) for advice on addressing powerful permissions in Kubernetes clusters.


## Quick Start
Requires [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)>=1.16.

1. Build `rbac-police`
```shell
go build
```
2. Connect `kubectl` to a Kubernetes cluster.
3. Evaluate RBAC permissions and identify privilege escalation paths in your cluster using the default policy library.
```shell
./rbac-police eval lib/
```

## Usage
### Set severity threshold
Only evaluate policies with a severity equal to or higher than a threshold.
```
./rbac-police eval lib/ -s High
```
### Scope to a namespace
Collect and evaluate RBAC permssions in a certain namespace.
```
./rbac-police eval lib/ -n production
```
### Only alert on SAs that exist on all nodes
Only consider violations from service accounts that exist on all nodes. Useful for identifying violating DaemonSets.
```
./rbac-police eval lib/ --only-sas-on-all-nodes
```
### Discover protections
Improve accuracy by identifying security-related features gates and admission controllers that can protect against certain attacks. Please note that [NodeRestriction](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction) is identified by impersonating a node and *dry-run creating a pod*, which may be logged by some systems.
```
./rbac-police eval lib/ -w
```
###  Ignore control plane
Ignore control plane pods and nodes in clusters that host the control plane.
```
./rbac-police eval lib/ --ignore-controlplane
```
### Nodes don't use NodeAuthorizer
Specify a custom user used by nodes in clusters that don't use the NodeAuthorizer.
```
./rbac-police eval lib/ --node-user=nodeclient
```
### Collect once for multiple evaluations
```
./rbac-police collect -o rbacDb.json
./rbac-police eval lib/ rbacDb.json -s Critical
./rbac-police eval lib/ rbacDb.json --only-sas-on-all-nodes
```
### Manually inspect RBAC permissions
```
./rbac-police expand
```
Or:
```
./rbac-police collect -o rbacDb.json
./rbac-police expand rbacDb.json
```
