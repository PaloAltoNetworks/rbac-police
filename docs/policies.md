# Policies
Policies are [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) scripts that detect identities like service accounts possessing RBAC permissions that match certain rule definitions. Policies produce violations, which can have 5 types:
- **ServiceAccounts**: Service accounts that violate the policy based on their permissions.
- **Nodes**: Nodes that violate the policy based on their permissions.
- **Users**: Users that violate the policy based on their permissions.
- **Groups**: Groups that violate the policy based on their permissions.
- **Combined**: Nodes that violate the policy based on the union of their permissions and the permissions of the service accounts they host.

The policy library at [lib](./lib) includes ~20 policies that identify identities that possess risky permissions, each detecting a different attack path.

## Writing Custom Policies
Policies are written in Rego, and receive input in the schema produced by `rbac-police collect`, as defined in [collect.md](./collect.md). Policies should define a `describe` rule, at least one violation type they produce, alongside one or two evaluators. Below is the [nodes_proxy](../lib/nodes_proxy.rego) policy, for example.

```rego
package policy
import data.police_builtins as pb

describe[{"desc": desc, "severity": severity}] {
  desc := "Identities with access to the nodes/proxy subresource can execute code on pods via the Kubelet API"
  severity := "High"
}
targets := {"serviceAccounts", "nodes", "users", "groups"}

evaluateRoles(roles, owner) {
  rule := roles[_].rules[_]
  pb.valueOrWildcard(rule.verbs, "create")
  pb.subresourceOrWildcard(rule.resources, "nodes/proxy")
  pb.valueOrWildcard(rule.apiGroups, "")
} 
```

- A policy must start with `package policy`.
- A policy can import a number of built-in utility functions from [builtins.rego](../lib/utils/builtins.rego) via `import data.police_builtins`.
- The `describe` rule defines the description and severity of the policy.
- The `targets` set configures which identities the policy evaluates.
- The `evaluateRoles` function receives the `roles` of a serviceAccount, node, user, or group and based on them determines whether it violates the policy.
- Policies can define an `evalute_combined` rule to produce combined violations. See [approve_csrs](../lib/approve_csrs.rego) for an example.

The above options are implemented by a Rego [wrapper](../lib/utils/wrapper.rego). If more control over execution is needed, a policy can be written to run independently, without the wrapper. See the [providerIAM](../lib/providerIAM.rego) policy for an example.
